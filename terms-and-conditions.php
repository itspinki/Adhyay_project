					<p>Every effort will be made to ensure that your meeting space requirements are met.</p>
					<p>If we cannot meet your exact requirements we will try to arrange a suitable alternative with you.</p>
					<p>If requesting a video conference (VC), it is wise to book meetings as far in advance as possible due to the need to pre-test connections of all rooms and devices.
					To ensure the meeting runs smoothly we require certain information from you at the time of the booking.
					</p><br/>
					
					<p>This will include your personal details, such as your name and email address. If VC, contact and connection information including ISDN/IP numbers or mobile devices of any private locations you wish to include in the conference. The meeting link confirms the meeting request to users via sending an invitation link.</p>
					
					<br/>
					
					<p>Please note that a meeting space booking is not valid until a link is shared with the participants issued by AdhyayYu. If this is NOT received when expected, please alert the AdhyayYu team immediately.</p>

If AdhyayYu is not responsible for providing the video connection via their 3rd party providers, AdhyayYu guarantees service quality or be held responsible for the success of the connections as there are too many technical variables outside of Adhyay’s control. We will do everything we reasonably can to ensure a successful meeting.</p>
