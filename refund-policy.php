					How to cancel your ticket
				</div>
				<div class="srms__paragraph paragraph--1 srms__top--paragraph">
					<p>Note: The option to cancel a ticket only appears if the host accepts cancellations for the event. If the host has not implemented a ticket cancellation policy for the event or if the ticket cancellation occurs outside of the applicable cancellation period, the host makes the final decision to accept or deny a cancellation request. The host is not obligated to approve a cancellation request. The host can cancel an order for single/series events.</p>
					<br/>
					
					<p>If the host cancels the paid events, which already have the ticket sales, the attendee will get a full refund.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>If there are some occurrences of an event series with ticket sales, the host can cancel some of the event occurrences. Zoom Events has a partial refund functionality for single-session and event series. Event organisers can now accept attendees’ partial refund requests. At the event level, some occurrences of the entire event series can be cancelled and the amount of those occurrences will be partially refunded. At the ticket level, some tickets of the entire order can be cancelled and refunded.</p>
					<br/>
					
					<p>An attendee can also get a full refund if the host approves the cancellation request, which can happen within 1 hour of the start of the event up to 14 days after the event ends. Refunds outside of the cancellation policy are at the sole discretion of the host. Once 14 days have passed since an event has ended, refunds for the event may not be requested or initiated, as further discussed in the Adhyay Events Terms of Use.</p>
					<br/>
					
					<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you paid for a ticket sold in a foreign currency, your refund may be more or less than the original amount that you paid depending on the exchange rate at the time of the purchase and refund.</p>

					How ticket purchases are refunded
				</div>
				<div class="srms__paragraph paragraph--1 srms__top--paragraph">
					<p>Once a refund request is approved, the cost of the ticket will return to you (the purchaser), and the ticket will be voided.</p>
					
					<p>If you paid for an event in the same currency that your credit or debit card was issued in—normally the currency of the country where you opened/registered for the card—and make a refund request, and if your refund is accepted, you will receive a refund for the same value regardless of the currency the host charges for tickets in.</p>
					
					<p><strong>Example:</strong> You have a USD-issued credit card and you purchase a $10.00 USD ticket. If you request a refund and it is approved, you will always receive back your exact purchase price—which would be $10.00 USD in this example.</p>
					<p><strong>Note:</strong>  If you paid for a ticket sold in a foreign currency, your refund may be more or less than the original amount that you paid depending on the exchange rate at the time of the purchase and refund.</p>

					Partial refund policy
				</div>
				<div class="srms__paragraph paragraph--1 srms__top--paragraph">
					<p><strong>Note:</strong> Currently, the partial refund policy is only available for single events/event series.</p>
					
					<p>In addition to implementing a full refund policy, a partial refund policy can also be implemented to provide a refund option for additional scenarios. The host can configure a partial refund policy at the event and ticket level. The host can cancel some occurrences of the entire series if the tickets are sold. The host can initiate a 50% refund based on the cases.</p>
					
					<p>You can cancel some tickets of the entire order for a single event. You can also cancel some occurrences of the entire series for a single event.</p>
					<p>When the host cancels one or more occurrences in an event series, the cost of the tickets being refunded will automatically be credited to the user.</p>
